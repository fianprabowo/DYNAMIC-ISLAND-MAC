# DYNAMIC-ISLAND-MAC

A Dynamic Island for the MacBook notch, in the style of NotchNook. It's a menu bar app built with SwiftUI and AppKit.

## Features

- **Collapsed notch.** While something is live, wings appear beside the notch:
  - album art and equalizer bars while Spotify or Music plays;
  - a pulsing Claude icon while Claude Code is working;
  - a badge for unread notifications.
- **Expanded notch.** Hover over or click the notch to open it. Pin it (next to the settings icon) to keep it open. It has two tabs:
  - **Nook:** now playing with controls, a calendar week strip with events, and Claude usage (plan limits left plus tokens today).
  - **System:** battery, CPU, memory, network, temperatures and notifications.
- **Floating mode.** Turn off *Pin to Notch* in the menu bar icon's menu to let the island float freely.

## Requirements

- macOS 27 (the Xcode project's deployment target).
- Xcode.
- `jq`, for the Claude Code status line script.

## Build and run

Open `DynamicIsland.xcodeproj` in Xcode and run the `MyApp` scheme. You can also build it from the command line:

```sh
xcodebuild -scheme MyApp -configuration Release -derivedDataPath build build
ditto build/Build/Products/Release/MyApp.app "/Applications/Dynamic Island.app"
open "/Applications/Dynamic Island.app"
```

On first use macOS asks for these permissions:

- **Calendars:** for the calendar strip.
- **Automation (Spotify / Music):** for the current track and playback controls.

By default the app is signed ad hoc, so macOS treats each new build as a new app and asks again. To keep the permissions across builds, sign with a stable identity: create `Signing.local.xcconfig` (not committed) next to `Signing.xcconfig` with your identity, for example an Apple Development certificate or a self-signed code signing certificate:

```
CODE_SIGN_STYLE = Manual
CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY = DynamicIsland Local Signing
```

## Claude plan usage

The 5-hour and weekly limits come from the Claude Code status line. To set it up:

1. Copy the script:

   ```sh
   cp scripts/claude-statusline.sh ~/.claude/dynamic-island-statusline.sh
   chmod 700 ~/.claude/dynamic-island-statusline.sh
   ```

2. Add this to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

   ```json
   "statusLine": { "type": "command", "command": "~/.claude/dynamic-island-statusline.sh" }
   ```

On each refresh the script saves the status JSON to `~/Library/Application Support/DynamicIsland/claude-status.json`, where the app reads it. It also prints the model and usage bars as the Claude Code status line. Token counts for today are read from Claude Code's local transcripts in `~/.claude/projects`.
